# Music Genre Classification

**Language:** Python

**Framework:** PyTorch

**Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

**Cloud Service:** Microsoft Azure

## Overview

As a streaming media, we are faced with a serious problem that misclassification on music genre has harmed user experience and therefore customer churn and profit loss. Worse more, doing music labeling by human labor is time-consuming and expensive. To mitigate this issue, we design an automatic music labeling solution by music feature extraction and deep learning algorithms application. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) with dropout method outperformed all other models in term of processing time and highest accuracy at 93%. Compared to manual labelling, our solution lessens the time for classification by about 6,000 times and reduce the variable cost to almost 0. By using this solution, we finally reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of music genre classification, which is expected to benefit user experience and make profits for our company. These findings also offer practical implications to technology and streaming media practitioners.
